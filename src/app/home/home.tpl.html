<h1>So what is the Capathon?</h1>



<p>The Capathon is a 48 hours non-stop coding challenge (a.k.a. hackathon). During this time, various teams will battle each other and strive to develop the best and most innovative ideas into working products.
</p>
<p>The event will take place in a hotel where you will be accommodated with a place to work and sleep (if you really must). This will involve wifi, lots of caffeine, breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, games and other necessities to keep you going for 48 hours.
</p>
<p>At the end of the challenge, a jury will pick a winner and a great prize will be given to your entire team. “There can be only one”, so make sure it’s your team! The event will be concluded with music and drinks.
</p>

<h2>Time and Place</h2>

<p>The Capathon kicks off on Thursday, the 4<sup>th</sup> of February 2016 at 18:00 at the <a href="http://www.haje.nu/hotel-heerenveen" target="_blank">Haj&eacute; Hotel Heerenveen</a> in Friesland (the North). The contest runs until the 6<sup>st</sup> of February... exactly 48 hours later. After that, the evening program then runs until around 22:00.</p>

<h2>What's the deal on Friday?</h2>

<p>Good question. Employees from the following practices will get this friday as a gift from the company:</p>

<h1>Who should participate?</h1>


<p>Everybody! Just make sure you form a team with people from various disciplines. Doing so will help you overcome challenges you may not be able to overcome when you form a team of just business analysts or only tibco developers. So, make sure you have a nice, multi-disciplinary team.
</p>
<p>To enroll, you need to have a Scrum-sized team (between 3 and 9 people). This is in the rules, and is non-negotiable.
</p>
<p>However, you are not limited to form a team of your practice. You may also invite people from other SBU’s within Capgemini, the client, or even friends or family who have no connection to Capgemini. As a matter of fact, highly encourage you inviting the client or your friends and family.

<h1>Signing up and Grooming session</h1>

<p>So you are interested and want to sign up immediately, right? Well there’s a few things that you need to take care of before you can participate in the Capathon.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>You need to register the names of your Scrum team members</li>
    <li>You need to appoint a team leader</li>
    <li>You need to enter a name for your team</li>
    <li>You need to enter a short description of what you want to develop</li>

<p>Of course, the composition of your team can be changed later… However, the organization wants to know about how many people will be participating.
</p>
<p>You have to sign up via this website before the 31st of January.
</p>
<p>After the teams have been submitted, the team will be invited to participate in a ‘grooming session’. During this session, the team tell about their plans and the capathon organization will try to challenge these plans with the goal to come up with a realistic innovative backlog draft to be used during the Capathon. This backlog will also be shared with the other teams on this website.
